## Description

The PWA Text Editor is a sophisticated, single-page application that functions both online and offline, meeting all the PWA criteria. This application is designed to offer developers the ability to create and save notes or code snippets with the convenience of persistent data storage through IndexedDB, making it possible to retrieve them at any point, with or without an internet connection. Built upon an existing application, this project incorporates the idb packageâ€”a lightweight IndexedDB API wrapper employed by giants like Google and Mozilla.
